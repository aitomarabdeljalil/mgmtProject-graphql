# Project Management GraphQL API

This project implements a GraphQL API for managing projects and clients. It provides a flexible and efficient way to query and manipulate data related to projects and their associated clients.

---

## Features

- Query individual projects and clients by ID
- Retrieve lists of all projects and clients
- (Assuming there are mutations) Create, update, and delete projects and clients

---

## Schema

The GraphQL schema defines the following main types:

- `Project`: Represents a project in the system
- `Client`: Represents a client associated with projects

---

### Root Query

The Root Query provides the following entry points:

- `project(id: ID!)`: Retrieve a single project by its ID
- `projects`: Retrieve a list of all projects
- `client(id: ID!)`: Retrieve a single client by its ID
- `clients`: Retrieve a list of all clients

---

## Usage

To interact with the API, you can use GraphQL queries. Here are some example queries:

```graphql
# Get all projects
query {
  projects {
    id
    name
    # Add other fields as needed
  }
}

# Get a specific project
query {
  project(id: "project_id_here") {
    id
    name
    # Add other fields as needed
  }
}

# Get all clients
query {
  clients {
    id
    name
    # Add other fields as needed
  }
}

# Get a specific client
query {
  client(id: "client_id_here") {
    id
    name
    # Add other fields as needed
  }
}
```
